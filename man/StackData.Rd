\title{Sample Stack Data}
\format{A list of 3 variables containing Gene Expression (GE), Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) and drug sensitivity measure (AUC):
\describe{
  \item{GE}{Gene Expression (GE) data corresponding to cell lines tested by the drug 17-AAG taken from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Relieff has been run to select the top 150 genes. }
  \item{RPPA}{Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) data corresponding to cell lines tested by the drug 17-AAG taken from the MD Anderson Cell Lines Project. Relieff has been run to select the top 150 proteins.}
  \item{AUC}{Area under the Dose-Responce Curve (AUC) corresponding to the drug 17-AAG applied to each cell line. Taken from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. }

\description{
A demo dataset containing Gene Expression (GE), Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) and drug sensitivity measure (AUC) for cancer cell lines that have been tested for the drug 17-AAG. Used to demonstrate the benefits of stacking by building an integrated model that will more effectively predict the AUC values given both GE and RPPA data.
