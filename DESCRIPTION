Title: Bootstrap Stacking of Random Forest Models for Heterogeneous
        Data
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Kevin Matlock, Raziur Rahman
Maintainer: Kevin Matlock <kevin.matlock@gmail.com>
Description: Generates and predicts a set of linearly stacked Random Forest models using bootstrap sampling. Individual datasets may be heterogeneous (not all samples have full sets of features). Contains support for parallelization but the user should register their cores before running. This is an extension of the method found in Matlock (2018) <doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2060-2>.
